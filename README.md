# PowerShellGalleryStats

The project was created with a dual purpose: to showcase the most outstanding PowerShell modules and to provide a tangible incentive for authors who consistently adhere to best practices.

We achieve this by meticulously analyzing and scoring every module based on its metadata and source code. Modules are then ranked according to their scores, with the highest-scoring modules earning a share of the donation pool contributed by our generous sponsors.

We envision a thriving PowerShell community where high-quality, well-maintained, and secure modules set the standard. By providing visibility to top-performing modules and offering financial rewards, we strive to inspire more developers to adopt and maintain best practices, ultimately benefiting the entire PowerShell ecosystem.
