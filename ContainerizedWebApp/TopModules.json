In order to manage each AWS service, install the corresponding module (e.g. AWS.Tools.EC2, AWS.Tools.S3...).\r\nThe module AWS.Tools.Installer (https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AWS.Tools.Installer/) makes it easier to install, update and uninstall the AWS.Tools modules.\r\nThis version of AWS Tools for PowerShell is compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell Core 6+ on Windows, Linux and macOS. When running on Windows PowerShell, .NET Framework 4.7.2 or newer is required. Alternative modules AWSPowerShell.NetCore and AWSPowerShell, provide support for all AWS services from a single module and also support older versions of Windows PowerShell and .NET Framework.",
