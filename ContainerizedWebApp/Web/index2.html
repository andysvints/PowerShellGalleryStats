                      The project was created with a dual purpose: to <b>showcase the most outstanding PowerShell modules</b> and to <b>provide a tangible incentive for authors who consistently adhere to best practices.</b>
                      <br>We achieve this by meticulously analyzing and scoring every module based on its metadata and source code. Modules are then ranked according to their scores, with the highest-scoring modules earning a share of the donation pool contributed by our generous sponsors.
                      <br>We envision a thriving PowerShell community where high-quality, well-maintained, and secure modules set the standard. By providing visibility to top-performing modules and offering financial rewards, we strive to inspire more developers to adopt and maintain best practices, ultimately benefiting the entire PowerShell ecosystem.

                    <span class="hint">PowerShell Gallery Stats was founded by a group of passionate PowerShell enthusiasts who believe in the power of open-source and the importance of quality and security. </span>
                  <span class="title">Scoring Criteria</span>

    <li>Code Quality - Assessing adherence to PowerShell coding standards and best practices.</li>
    <li>Documentation - The presence of clear, comprehensive documentation.</li>
    <li>Security - Ensuring that modules follow security best practices.</li>
    <li>Community Engagement - The moduleâ€™s responsiveness to issues and pull requests.</li>
