            <h3>Mission & Vision</h3>
            <p>The project was created with a dual purpose: to <b>showcase the most outstanding PowerShell modules</b> and to <b>provide a tangible incentive for authors who consistently adhere to best practices.</b></p>
            <p>We achieve this by meticulously analyzing and scoring every module based on its metadata and source code. Modules are then ranked according to their scores, with the highest-scoring modules earning a share of the donation pool contributed by our generous sponsors.</p>
            <p>We envision a thriving PowerShell community where high-quality, well-maintained, and secure modules set the standard. By providing visibility to top-performing modules and offering financial rewards, we strive to inspire more developers to adopt and maintain best practices, ultimately benefiting the entire PowerShell ecosystem.</p>
            <br><br>

            <h3>Who Created It</h3>
            <p>PowerShell Gallery Stats was founded by a group of passionate PowerShell enthusiasts who believe in the power of open-source and the importance of quality and security. </p>
            <p><b>Our team is committed to helping the PowerShell community grow stronger, one module at a time.</b></p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Scoring Criteria</h2>
            <p>Our scoring system evaluates modules based on several factors, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Code Quality: Assessing adherence to PowerShell coding standards and best practices.</li>
                    <li>Documentation: The presence of clear, comprehensive documentation.</li>
                    <li>Security: Ensuring that modules follow security best practices.</li>
                    <li>Community Engagement: The moduleâ€™s responsiveness to issues and pull requests.</li>
                </ul>
